1. Total time spent: 

- Getting started screen
Around 7 hours knowing that I have implemented the UI for the all app at the same time of the first UI levers logics.

- Login Screen
Around 7 hours as I have started to implement the view model logic as well as the one for the Profile view.

- Signup screen
Around 2 hours as it was the last one I took care of, and all the main logic was already implemented.

- Profile Screen
Around 2 hours as it was a balance between the login screen and the sign up screen.



2. How challenging did you find the task: [ x] Easy [ ] Medium [ ] Hard



3. What were the most challenging parts:
Refer to question number 5 üòÖ



4. Any additional comments about the task/implementation:
This is an explanation about how to run the project as I have done it with a fake network and a server side as well.


‚óè To run the project with the fake server side:
- Checkout the main branch from the MyworkoutGo root project.
- From this same branch, checkout commit number: `5441322 version 1.0 with fake network request`
- Open MyworkoutGO.xcodeproj and run the project on a simulator or device.


‚óè To run the project with MyworkoutGOServerSide: 
- Open MyworkoutGOServerSide and follow the README.md instructions to start the server on your localhost.
- Checkout the main branch from the MyworkoutGo root project.
- From this same branch, checkout commit number: `35ea16f version 1.0 with MyworkoutGOServerSide for network request` or later. 
- Open MyworkoutGO.xcodeproj and run the project on a simulator or device.



5. If you had more time to complete the test, are there any specific changes/refactoring that you would have liked to do: 
Which is part of the question number 3 because it was the most challenging part of this project. 
I would have loved to find the memory leak that I spent a lot of time indestigating with Instruments. 
It seems like SwiftUI creates this leak but I could not finish my investigations as I wanted to send you the project.
It is working fine for you to run it, but not for a public release for sure.
